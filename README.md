# Overview
Using an SDS011, a DHT22, and a OLED screen, get and display data.

## What Is SDS011
SDS011 is an inexpensive particle matter sensor (lazer based) that senses pm 2.5 and PM 10 particles. It is sold by inovafitness based in China.

## What Is DHT22
The DHT22 is a very inexpensive temperature and humidity sensor.

## What Is OLED Screen
OLED screen is a 128 by 32 pixel organic light emmitting diode screen. It's very bright, low power and inexpensive.

## What Is Special About This Project
Nothing. But if you want an air pollution sensor in your house to check indoor air quality, I recommend you borrow my code. It could save you a lot of time. The biggest problem is I don't have a skematic or wiring diragram. The reason is because I'm not finished making my own. When I finish and have some extra time I will try to offer a diring diagram so others can easily use this code.
